## MGS Harmony Composer
***
MGS Harmony Composer is a software tool that helps users create and manage GUI elements for their applications. It is part of MGS, which is a comprehensive, easy-to-use set of graphics tools for developing GUIs for Microchip's 32-bit microcontrollers (MCUs) and microprocessors (MPUs).

For additional information, visit the [MGS Harmony Composer User Guide](https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/software-tools/mgs/mgs-harmony-guide/composer-ug/) at Microchip Develop Help.

***
## MGS Simulator
***
MGS Harmony Simulator allows developers to prototype and debug graphics applications on a PC, before deploying them on the actual hardware. It emulates the graphics controller of an MCU/MPU, allowing you to see the output of your code in real-time. 

For information on how to download and use the Simulator as a productivity tools to shorten development time and reduce the overall cost of your embedded GUI designs, visit the [MGS Simulator User Guide](https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/software-tools/mgs/mgs-harmony-guide/simulator/) at Microchip Develop Help.
