### Known Issues

* Applications running on SAM E70 in combination with LCC will observe visual rendering artifacts on display during SD card R/W access. There is no loss in SD Card data.
* For applications on SAM E54 + CPRO with the 24-bit passthrough board, Pin 7 of the EXT1 connector should drive the backlight. However, on rev1.0 of the board, it is not connected to any pin on the MCU. As a workaround, it needs to be connected to a v3.3 pin.
* MISRA 2012 Rule 9.1 Compliance Deviation at legato_error.c line 74
